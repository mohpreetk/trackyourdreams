# Track Your Dreams
Track your dreams is a javascript based to-do list. It is just a front end project and does not store any data for now, but you can pin the webpage to keep your data.
You can add a new goal. mark it as completed or delete it. 
The website also uses iframe and YouTube Api to load youtube videos if you want to search for something (motivation, howto etc).
Fun sounds are added as you add, complete or delete your goals.
Go ahead and have fun.
